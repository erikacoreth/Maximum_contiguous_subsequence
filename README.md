# Maximum Contiguous Subsequence Sum (MCSS)

This Python script finds the **Maximum Contiguous Subsequence Sum (MCSS)** within a randomly generated list of integers using an optimized approach similar to **Kadane's Algorithm**.

## How It Works

1. A list (`vector`) of 1000 random integers between -100 and 100 is generated.
2. The `MCSS` function iterates through the list to determine the contiguous subarray with the highest sum.
3. The function returns:
   - The maximum sum.
   - The starting index of the subarray.
   - The ending index of the subarray.
4. The results are printed to the console.
